# Logistic-Regression-Classifier-to-Recognize-Cats
Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset .Given the small dataset ("data.h5") , I'll build a Logistic Regression Classifier to Recognize Cats. by building the general architecture of a Learning Algorithm, including :
* Initializing parameters .
* Calculating the cost function and its gradient .
* Using an Optimization Algorithm (Gradient Descent).
* Merge all these functions above in main Model function , in the right order .
* Evaluate the Model
